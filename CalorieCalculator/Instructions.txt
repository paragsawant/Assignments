DESCRIPTION
----------------------------------------------
CalorieCalculator is a simple library that calculates a person's ideal body weight and 
daily recommended caloric intake based on sex, age, height and weight. 

A test harness (Program.cs) has been written to exercise and test the public API (Calc.cs). 
It runs the caluation, saves it, and retrieve the entire calculation history.


REFACTOR THE APPLICATION
----------------------------------------------
Your manager was not very pleased with the intial implementation of this library and has
instructed you to have a look and offer up your suggestions for improvement. Specifically, 
he wants to know what needs to be done to transform this into a more decoupled, maintainable 
Object-Oriented design. He informs you that THE EXISTING PUBLIC API (CalorieCalculator.API)
SHOULD NOT CHANGE for systems that already use this API today.  


INSTRUCTIONS
----------------------------------------------
Please complete one of the following options. Our preference is for you to directly
refactor this code. However, if time does not permit, option 2 is acceptable but you should 
be very specific in terms of your proposed system design and domain object model. 

Option 1 (PREFERRED) : Refactor this code directly.

Option 2 : Describe how you would re-design the system. Be very specific with a supporting 
		   system design and object domain model (please provide UML class diagrams).
		   


PREFERRED DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT / PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE
---------------------------------------------------------
If you do not have Visual Studio or are not comfortable with .NET/C#, any platform or
language will suffice. Again, we are more interested in your design approach and less about the low level 
implementation details of the code.
